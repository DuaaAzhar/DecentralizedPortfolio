# React + Vite
- Clone the repository
- run `npm i`
- Then run `npm run dev` to start the project
- Install the metamask and do the basic setup and account creation. Connect with either **Sepolia** or **Mumbai** testnet.
- Now connect your metamask with button **"Connect Metamask"** and **PORTFOLIO** is ready to see **!!**


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
